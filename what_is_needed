envionment is Python on PC, connected to SCPI server on RedPitaya

need to read, from RF input, N points at SR sampling rate 
can we do it untriggered?
if not, workaround, by using a self-generated signal to ext trigger?

done so far: hello world works, i.e. can toggle led and can read slow analog input
